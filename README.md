Analysis of shotgun sequencing &amp; hybridization capture data of Holocene High Arctic sedaDNA

Here, I provide the code that was used for the processing, filtering, and analysis of the shotgun sequencing and hybridization capture data of sedimentary ancient DNA from four marine sediment core from around Northern Greenland.

The processing of the sequencing data and taxonomic classification were carried out on a HPC The code to process the data is part of this README. Further data processing, filtering and the analysis of the data was carried out in R. The R-scripts are part of this repository and the README guides through the order of running them.
